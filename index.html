      <p>If you're reading this page, chances are you're looking to learn some basic HTML. This website has 7 short and simple lessons. After you have completed the lessons, you will be able to write a basic HTML webpage.</p>
      <h2>What Is HTML?</h2>
      <p>HTML is a standard markup language designed by Tim Berners-Lee. HTML defines the content and structure of a webpage. You can use HTML is conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to make a fully functional webpage. With only HTML, you will have little to no interactivity, and the style of your webpage may be lacking. But HTML is still a very useful language to know, as without it, webpages would have no text, links, etc.</p>
      <p>HTML needs to be writen in a text-editing program. There are text-editing programs that work on a browser, and ones that work only when downloaded onto your device. On Windows, you can use the NotePad text editor, and on Mac, use TextEdit. Once you have access to a text editor, you can start to learn to code!</p>
