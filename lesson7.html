      <h1>Lesson 7: Semantic Tagging</h1>
      <h2>Semantic Tags</h2>
      <p>Semantic tags are a kind of tag that has an inherent meaning, which makes it very useful for people who use screenreaders to understand the organization of your webpage. Take the tag &lt;div&gt;, for example. The "div" tag is very useful for programmers, but because it is not a semantic tag, it has certain deficiencies. The pupose of "div" is to define the beginning of a new section of your webpage. It absolutely has its purpose, but is often overused by programmers. Additionally, screenreaders can't intepret the meaning of the "div" tag because of its ambiguity, so people who are visually impaired would have a lot of trouble reading the webpage. Other non-semantic organizational tags include &lt;span&gt; and &lt;hr&gt;.</p>
      <p>Instead of &lt;div&gt;, though, you can instead use its semantic counterpart, &lt;section&gt;. Screen readers understand what that tag means in the context of a webpage, which in turn means that people whoa re visually impaired will people able to understand that they are reading a new section of the webapge. Other semantic tags include &lt;main&gt; (the main content of a webpage), &lt;nav&gt; (the part of the webapge with links to other pages), &lt;footer&gt; (the bottom of the page), &lt;header&gt; (the top of the webpage), &lt;aside&gt; (a section of secondary and complemenatry text), and &lt;article&gt; (a section with its own clear topic).</p>
