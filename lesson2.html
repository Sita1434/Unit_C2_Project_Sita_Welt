      <h1>Lesson 2: Comments And Attributes</h1>
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <p>When you put code in a comment, it disables the code. This is useful for leaving notes to yourself or collaborators, or for keeping code you aren't sure about using in a way that won't affect the rest of your webpage. &lt;!-- This is a correctly-written comment in HTML.--&gt;. If you were to copy-paste the previous sentence into a text-editor, it would not show up on a webpage because it is enclosed in a comment.</p>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p style="color:darkblue">Tags often have attributes that modify the tag. Notice how this paragraph has dark blue text. This can be added with a style attribute inside a paragraph attribute. That would look like this: &lt;p style="color:darkblue"&gt; This will have dark blue text &lt;/p&gt;. </p>
